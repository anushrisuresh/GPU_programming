# GPU Programming Assignments

This repository contains my GPU Programming coursework submissions.

Each module folder (e.g. `module_05/`) contains:
- Source code (`src/`)
- Build scripts / Makefile
- Run scripts and logs
- Assignment-specific README documenting requirements and results

## Structure
- **module_05/** â€“ Memory Types Assignment  
  Demonstrates host, global, shared, constant, and register memory in CUDA,
  includes timing comparisons, CLI argument support, and screenshots.

Future modules will follow the same structure, with their own code, README, and logs.
